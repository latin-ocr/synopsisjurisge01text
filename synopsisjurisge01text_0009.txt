PREFACE.

The Carnegie Institution of Washington has undertaken the
republication of the leading classics of International Law and the
presentvolume, Textor's Synopsis Ju ris Gentium, Was edited With
an introduction, shortly before his death in 1913, by Ludwig von
Bar, the distinguished German publicist and for many years pro·
sessor at the University of GottIngen. The English translation
of the text of Textor's treatise has been made by Mr. John Pawley
Bate.

The reasons for including Textor's treatise, published for the
first time in 1680, are sufficiently set forth by Professor von Bar
in his introduction‚ but it may be said in this place and in passing
that Textor's treatise was in the nature of a protest against the
school of natural law, of which Pufendorf was the very head and
from, and contributed in no small measure to the conception of
International Law as a system of positive law, and that Textor,
by virtue of this work, occupies, alongside of his older con-
temporary, Rachel, an honorable rank as a member of the positive
school. The original text is exceedingly difficult to procure and
has not hitherto been translated into English. The photographic
reproduction places the work within the hands of scholars of any
and all countries, and Mr. John Pawley Bate's translation makes
its mastery an easy matter to the English-speaking world.

One reason for undertaking the reprinting 01 1116 Classics os
International Law is the difficulty of procuring the texts in con-
venient form for scientific study3 the libraries in the United States
have been searched with the result that few of the earlier works
were to be found. Another reason is that some of the works
selected for republication have never been translated into English.
The American publicist is therefore at a disadvantage in consult-
ing works of admitted authority, and when found they are. as it
were, sealed books to all but trained Latinists. The specialist is
thus forced to rely upon summary statements and references to
them to be found in treatises on International Lam or is driven to
examine them in European libraries, often a difficult task, while
the general reader is practically barred from the stores 0111110111-
edge locked up in the earlier works on the Law of Nations. The
