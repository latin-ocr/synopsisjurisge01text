same difficulty exists in Latin America‚ Japan, and in a lesser
degree in many Europe-an countries.

Eminent publicists‚ European and American, who have been
consulted as to the usefulness of the plan to republish the Classics‚
have indorsed the project and have pledged their personal co-
operation. The works to be included in the series have not only
been approved but suggested by therny so that the undertaking is
international in scope, in selection‚ and in execution.

'she underlying principle of selection has been to reissue those
works which can be said to have contributed either to the origin or
to the growth of International Law and the term classic has been
used in the broad rather than in the narrow sense, so that no work
will be omitted which can be said to have contributed to the origin
or growth ot' the Law os Nations. 'she masterpieces of Grotius
will naturally be the central point in the series, but the works of
his leading predecessors and successors will likewise be included.
The textos each author will be reproduced photographically‚ so
as to lay the source before the reader without the mistakes which
might creep into a newly printed text. In the case of the early
authors the photographed text will be accompanied by a revised
text whenever that course shall seem desirable. An Introduction
will be prelixed to each work, giving the necessary biographical
details and stating the importance of the text and its place in
lnternational Law; tables of errata will be added, and notes
deemed necessary to clear up doubts and ambiguities orto correct
mistakes in the text will be supplied. Variations in successive
editions ot' the text published in the author's lifetime will be noted,
but little or nothing in the nature of historical commentary will be
lurnished.

Each work will be accompanied by an English version made
expressly for the series by a competent translator.

lt is hoped that the series will enable general readers as well as
specialists to trace International Law from its faint and uncon-
scions beginnings to its present ample proportions and to forecast
with some degree of certainty its future development into that
law which hlirabeau tells us will one day rule the world.
